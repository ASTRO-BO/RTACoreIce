The RTACoreIce component contains a Publisher/Subscriber model for routing RTAEBSimIce buffers based on 3 topics: SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE (the telescope types).

To build use:

  $ make

To run you need to start the Ice Storm service:

  $ icebox --Ice.Config=config.icebox

Run the Publisher in a separate window:

  $ RTAReceiver_Ice file.stream

In other windows run the subscribers:

  $ RTAWave
